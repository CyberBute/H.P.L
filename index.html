                    <h2>Who is H.P. Lovecraft?</h2>
                </header>

                <p>Howard Phillips Lovecraft was an author and pionire of cosmic horror. Born in Rhode Island Aug 20, 1890 and met his end on march 15 1937 due to cancer (age 46). Lovecraft is well known for the creation of novels such as "Call of Cathulhu", "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath" and "The Shadow over Innsmouth." .Lovecraft stories where unique because he saw humanity as irelevant in the scheem of the grand cosmos and that we could be whiped away at anymoment. Another reason Lovecraft stories became a hit was also largly because of his immense fear of the unknown and things he didn't understand, most notably space and the sea.</p>
                <p>Lovecrafts childhood wasn't exactly great, as he was born into poverty and exerienced a lot of tragic things, that later on would become insperation for many Lovecraft stories to come. Lovecrafts never grew out of his childhood fears, and he embrasses most of them in his short stories. In 1924 Lovecraft also got married to a woman Sonia Haft Greene Davis, which later on would change her name to Sonia Haft Greene Lovecraft Davis. They would in the year 1933 end thier relationship and get a divorce with no children.</p>
                <p>Lovecraft wasn't exactly known when he where alive, but people he knew and some he worked with finished up  some of his his work and he got a lot of fame a good time after his death. Now people write thier own version of the so called Cthulhu Mythos, and a lot of movie producers, writers and game devs pay thier respect to his work trough thier own work</p>

                </header>

                <p>H.P Lovecrafts stories and novels where often about "cosmic beings" often so horrific that people die at the sight of some. They where mostly depicted as monsters with tentacles and weird meaty blop shapes. His most notable once being Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep and Cthulhu. The uniqeness of these monsters is that it's rare for them to care about humans, (often not caring is the humans demise) with a few exeptions like ofcourse Nyarlathotep whom enjoys watching beings suffer. A lot of Lovecraftian monsters and places would later on have a huge popculture impact which is still very notable today.</p>
